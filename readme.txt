== Description ==

Job Board Creator turns your WordPress site into a powerful job board. Currently, JBC requires themes (such as Job Board Framework) that are specifically designed for this plugin. What's more, in order to charge a fee for job postings, you will need our PayPal Gateway plugin. Themes and plugins can be found on our web site <http://jbcreator.com>

2. Activate the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I make users pay  fee to submit a job posting? =

Firstly, visit <http://jbcreator.com> and download our download PayPal Gateway plugin to enable payment functionality.

Next, visit wp-admin/jobs/views/ and select (or create a new) "view" and define a price under the "price" field.

= How can I create a job posting? =

You can create a job posting from your admin area (wp-admin -> jobs -> add new). However, generally, users are meant to submit using your site's frontend via 
http://example.com/post/ 

However, your URL may differ if you have defined a custom page on your JBC settings page.

== Troubleshooting ==

1. Unable to receieve email notifications

Make sure to check your junk/spam folder. Otherwise, contact your email provider as they may blocking emails from your server for some reason.

NOTE: Generally you shouldn't send e-mails using your server. Instead, you should use a specialized e-mail service provider (such as MailJet or SendInBlue).
