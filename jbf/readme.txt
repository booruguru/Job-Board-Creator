=== JobHunter ===

This allows you to create an advanced job bank platform on your WordPress web site.

You can charge employers using our option PayPal payment gateway plugin (UserPayments).

== Features ==



== Installation & Setup ==


1. Upload JobTheme to you theme directory.

2. Activate JobTheme

3. Go to wp-admin -> Appearance -> Theme Options

4. Save/update the settings (even if you haven't made any changes). 

== Getting Started ==

1. You can visit your job board by visiting yoursite.com/jobs/

2. You can also set the job board as your front page by visiting "wp-admin -> settings -> reading" then select "a static page" and then select the "Listings" page (or whatever page you have created using the listing.php template) from the "Front page" dropdown menu. 

3. By default JobHunter should have created all of the pages it requires for creating and managing job posts.


== Create Job Posting ==

You can create a job posting from your admin area (wp-admin -> jobs -> add new). However, generally, users are meant to submit using your site's frontend via 
http://example.com/post/ 

== Customization ==

1. Expiration Date

You can define the expiration date for job posting under the "views" screen (wp-admin -> jobs -> views). By default, you should have a view called "Standard."

You can create, edit/rename, and delete "views" as you require.

The duration field allows you to define the number of days a job posting should remain visible. Once the period has expired, the post is sent to the trash, but can still be recovered.

2. Price

If you are using the PayPal UserPayments add-on, you can require users to pay for submitting job postings (while also offering free options). Simply use the price field for a job post "view."

== Troubleshooting ==

1. Unable to receieve email notifications

Make sure to check your junk/spam folder. Otherwise, contact your email provider as they may blocking emails from your server for some reason.
